# Electric Vehicle Adoption Forecasting System

## 📌 Project Overview
The Electric Vehicle Adoption Forecasting System is a data-driven analytics project designed to predict future trends in electric vehicle (EV) adoption. Using historical EV population data, vehicle types, and growth patterns, the project applies machine learning and time-series forecasting techniques to estimate the number of electric vehicles in upcoming years.

This project demonstrates the practical application of **Business Analytics, predictive modeling, and sustainability-focused data analysis** to support informed decision-making for policymakers, businesses, and infrastructure planners.
